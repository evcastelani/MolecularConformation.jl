# MolecularConformation.jl

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiments provide distances between atoms of a protein molecule. Using these distance the conformation molecular problem is to determine the 3D protein structur. This package is a class of solvers to get the spatial arrangement of the atoms in a molecule. The focus of this project is to establish a friendly environment to perform simulations, visualize solutions, interact with other environments such as [BioStructures.jl](https://github.com/BioJulia/BioStructures.jl) and, mainly, to develop new NMR-based molecular conformation methods.

!!! note
    Currently, the solvers related to this package are able to determine the position of atoms of the backbone chain of a molecule.
