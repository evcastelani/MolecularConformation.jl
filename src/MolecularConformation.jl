"""
``` 
conformation(NMRdata,cs::ConformationSetup)

```
This is the main function in order to get the conformation of a molecule. To run this function, we need to setup a NMR file and then define some options using the ConformationSetup type. 

## Example 

```julia-repl
julia> options = ConformationSetup(0.001,classicBP,true)

julia> conformation(NMRdata,options)
```
as return a ConformationOutput type is provided.

There are others parameters to setup, for example, need to complete.
